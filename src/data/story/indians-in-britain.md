# How are Indians treated in Britain?

#### *01 Aug 2017, London*

&nbsp;

This question was asked to me on Quora. I have redacted the names I have used here for prvacy reasons.

I have been fortunate to have travelled quite extensively before the age of 30. I have lived in London for over 3 years as of 2021. I lived in Berlin for 2 years. I also visited other EU countries. I moved houses every 6 months just to explore all parts of London. So I have lived in about 10 different places and that has helped me meet and talk to people of all kinds, nationalities, faiths, sexual orientations etc.

Before setting foot outside of India, I was concerned about racism. I did some online research about the life of foreigners in London and I remember reading that there are some dodgy (adj, dishonest or unreliable) areas in London where one shouldn't go. Also, I was concerned about language, about my career and about money. I took the flight on 1st of October 2016. The very place I ended up in when I landed there was the very dodgy place I had read about before. And it was truly dodgy. Not clean, smelled bad, police and ambulance sirens all the time and there was always someone creating some ruckus. Not the kind of the metropolitan city one would have in mind.

Most of Londoners in general are just amazing. I met the most helpful, down-to-earth people there. Everybody is treated fairly. Its truly multicultural. Its for a reason its the capital of the world. Its not just the buildings and the history that makes it great, its also the people. Fair and forward thinking. I was surprized in the initial days. Good things are celebrated, bad things protested. There is religious freedom, no police brutality, everybody is free to have an opinion and is free to disagree. Politicians are humble and truly serve the people. I'd say in the UK, I experienced the almost perfect model of democracy.

But, we are generally looked down upon. White supremacy is built into the system and it will take a long time for it to change.

## What the people think of India

The first things that come to their mind when it comes to India are - curry, poverty, cows on streets, magicians, snake charmers, bollywood, sarees, holi and IT. Many of them look forward to visiting India if not been there already just because its the land where bizzare things happen and they want to experience what it is to live like that. And thats it, thats all they know. Most people dont have any other opinion or knowledge of India.

The media likes to show India in poor light. India is easily brushed off as a "third world country". And that reflects everywhere. We have separate queues in Airports. We still needed a seperate visa to be able to travel to Europe even though we have a UK visa and we pay taxes and National Insurance and what not. We can't get certain bank accounts, we have additional checks in some, we cannot get a credit history.

## Pleasant anecdotes

I was surprised when a colleague of mine, Ad, told me I'm one of the smartest persons he knows. And I was like WTF? In India, I was just average.

One of my best friends is a Greek geek, Pa, who lives in London who has setup his own business there.

My collegues were amazing. An, Jo, Si, Ju, Ad, Mi, Gr and a lot of others. They were eager to talk, to listen, to party. Going to work was a pleasure. We were like a family for 3 years delivering great things. I wish that time never ended.

I made friends with the Turkish restaurant owners of Cirrik in Dalston. I am sure they'd recognize me the next time I see them because I was a regular there.

Once during a conversation about Brexit and immigration, I was talking about the insecurities I had as an immigrant and my friend Je insisted that I'm more a Londoner than an immigrant. Even I myself didnt think like that. That was a warm experience.

A friend of mine, Ma, travelled to India recently and said she had one of the best experiences ever. I visited Beligum with her.

I had a friend, Ro, who I talked to about my insecurities and she put up a good effort to help me out of it. A true Londoner.

Last but not the least, Co, who was my flatmate for a year, we became good friends very quickly, I used to share the things I cooked with her, she cooked me Italian Risotto once, we talked about all random things under the earth, we still do even after all those times.

## Unpleasant anecdotes

Most people live in flat shares in London. Asians generally get pushed to the far east, probably due to their economic conditions. Every city I go to has an area which dedicated to immigrants. The rents are cheap there and they setup their own little community there. The whole place looks different after a few years. I didnt want to go there. I tried to find my own room elsewhere. Below are some occasions where I felt discriminated.

In 2017, I had to move into a new place with only an oral consent of a rental agreement with the tenant moving out. But, the landlord asked me to move out when I asked for a rental agreement after a month. I later realized that he wanted to sublet the room to someone for a brief period who wouldn't need a rental agreement so he could save tax. It was so stupid of me to have trusted their words for it. I only asked for it after moving in and he refused on the grounds that I didn't have a 12 month tenancy history or previous rental agreements. I was happy to move out anyway. But it felt that me being an immigrant made for an easy target!

In 2018, my rental agency tried to scam me of 150Â£ for basic wear and tear and took me to the Deposit Protection Scheme whereas my other roommate wasn't, even though we both gave them the room in the same condition. I won the dispute but I thought they were making a soft target of me because of me being an immigrant they probably thought I wouldnt contest it.

In 2019, I took a break from work for a month and went back to India after the contract at my place ended. The plan was when I came back, my friend and I moved in together to a new place. He found a place but the landlord kept postponing signing the agreement. After a month of moving in, the guy wanted us to move out citing refurbishments as a reason. We threatened to go the police but some friends said its worthless without an agreement. We had a fierce argument on the phone but it didnt help. I wrote to the HMRC for tax evasion. Again, felt taken advantage of based on my situation.

Once after a late night out, I had to take my friend to her home as she was too drunk to walk. I had never been in such a situation before and I thought I couldnt just leave her there and decided to drop her at her home. She wasn't sober to even walk straight and I had to hold her. Some people in the station looked at me rather strangely and a lady asked me questions about where I was taking her. I explained her that I was only taking her to her home and I was going to my home after. She prayed to god in front of me which absolutely broke my heart. It was so stupid of me to have decided to take the tube and not catch a cab for her.

## Conclusion

I have come to realise that there is indeed a small degree of discrimination, systemic racism and white supremacy. But would I face it if I moved to a different part of the world? Absolutely. Would I myself discrimate someone based on my own preconcieved notions? I probably already have. And if there is any place on earth which comes out of this disease, it has to be London. It once was the seat of colonialism, but its now showing the way to the world.

Also, it also has to do with immigration policies in general. Does every immigrant want/have the wherewithals to live in a city like that and integrate with the society because they come from varied socio-economic backgrounds? I dont think so.

Living there had its ups and downs, but eventually, when I look back, I miss the place. Co once said London will eventually get to me. I refuted it back then but I am beginning to realize she might have been right after all.

And the number of amazing people there are more than the number of bad apples who I guess are there everywhere. As of July 2021, I'm back in London for yet another go. And this time, I start from experience.
