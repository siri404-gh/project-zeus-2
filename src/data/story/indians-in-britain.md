# How are Indians treated in Britain?

#### *01 Aug 2017, London*

&nbsp;

This question was asked to me on Quora.

## Background

I have been fortunate to have travelled quite extensively before the age of 30. I lived in London for 3 years. I also visited other countries like France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland etc. I haven't lived outside London and the results could vary. I moved houses every 6 months just to explore all parts of London. So I have lived in about 10 different places and that has helped me meet and talk to people of all kinds, nationalities, faiths, sexual orientations etc.

## Before setting foot outside India

I was concerned about racism. I did some online research about the life of foreigners in London and I remember reading that there are some dodgy (adj, dishonest or unreliable) areas in London where one shouldn't go. Also, I was concerned about language, about my career, about money. I took the flight on 1st of October 2016.

## Reaching a new country for the first time

The very place I ended up in when I landed there was the very dodgy place I had read about before. And it was truly dodgy. Not clean, smelled bad, police and ambulance sirens all the time and there was always someone wielding a knife, creating some ruckus. Not the kind of the metropolitan city one would have in mind. I had dreamt that my life would be like Hrithik's in ZNMD when he was in London. But in reality, it was something else.

## Londoners

Most of them are just amazing. I met the most helpful, down-to-earth people there. Everybody is treated fairly. Its truly multicultural. Its for a reason its the capital of the world. Its not just the buildings and the history that makes it great, its the people. Fair and forward thinking. I was surprized in the initial days. Good things are celebrated, bad things protested. There is religious freedom, no police brutality, everybody is free to have an opinion and is free to disagree. A good example is Shamima Begum's return to the country. It was discussed and debated.

## Indians in Britain

India is regarded generally as a friendly nation which doesnt export its problems. We have to get a degree, a certificate of sponsorship, a police verification certificate, a tuberculosis certificate and what not to even be considered for a Visa. Also a biometric residence permit and we have to pay our taxes and National Insurance once we land there. Thats a lot of contribution. But, many of our standards of life are different from the west. It took me a few years to come out of my ways of living to be a localite. For example, over dependence on Indian food although its available in plenty there.

## Image of India in Britian

The first things that come to their mind when it comes to India are - curry, poverty, cows on streets, bollywood, sarees, holi and IT. Many of them look forward to visiting India if not been there already. Few of my friends had travelled to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, but not India which surprised me but that's probably because it's a big nation and it needs big planning and budget. It is still regarded as a poor nation. But that image is changing. As the ties between both countries increase, the integration will increase. Bollywood will take care of the image clean up. Not movies like slumdog millionaire though.

## Pleasant stories

I was surprised when a colleague of mine, Ade, told me I'm one of the smartest persons he knows. And I was like WTF? In India, I was just average.

One of my best friends is a Greek geek, Pavlos, who lives in London who has setup his own business there.

My collegues were amazing. Anurag, Joel, Simon, Julie, Ade, Miguel, Graham and a lot of others. They were eager to talk, to listen, to party. Going to work was a pleasure. We were like a family for 3 years delivering great things. I wish that time never ended.

I made friends with the Turkish restaurant owners of Cirrik in Dalston. I am sure they'd recognize me the next time I see them because I was a regular there.

Once during a conversation about Brexit and immigration, I was talking about the insecurities I had as an immigrant and my friend Jenna insisted that I'm more a Londoner than an immigrant. Even I myself didnt think like that. That was a warm experience.

A friend of mine, Matina, travelled to India recently and said she had one of the best experiences ever. I visited Beligum with her.

I had a friend, Rosie, who I talked to about my insecurities and she put up a good effort to help me out of it. A true Londoner.

Last but not the least, Corrie, who was my flatmate for a year, we became good friends very quickly, I used to share the things I cooked with her, she cooked me Italian Risotto, we talked about all random things under the earth, we still do even after all those times.

## Bad things

India is still regarded as a "third world country" at least by the media. We have separate queues in Airports. We still needed a seperate visa to be able to travel to Europe even though we have a UK visa and we pay taxes and national Insurance (This was written pre-brexit). We can't get certain bank accounts, we have additional checks in some, we cannot get a credit history.

Many ignorant people think of Indians as people from a poor country, a country where cows roam on the roads, a poor country which they ruled and gave so much to. The British rule in India is a separate debate altogether but India has come a long way from there and people are just blatantly ignorant of that. They still have the pre independence image of India.

They only India some people know is from the movie Slumdog Millionare. They are aware of poverty and the safety issues in India which I cannot argue. But I got the feeling whole country is painted with the same brush, probably the media is to blame here. They like to sensationalise stories, show India in a poor light.

I read in Quora that some people think we stare a lot and it is indeed true to an extent.

Most people live in flat shares in London. Asians are generally pushed to the far east. I dont know why. Every city I go to have an area which dedicated to immigrants. The rents are cheap there and they setup their community there. The whole place looks different after a few years. I didnt want to go there. I tried to find my own room. You can either find a place yourself or get one through an agency. Below are some occasions where I felt discriminated.

In 2017, I had to move into a new place with only an oral consent of a rental agreement with the tenant moving out. But, the landlord asked me to move out when I asked for a rental agreement after a month. I later realized that he wanted to sublet the room to someone for a brief period who wouldn't need a rental agreement so he could save tax. It was so stupid of me to have trusted their words for it. I only asked for it after moving in and he refused on the grounds that I didn't have a 12 month tenancy history or previous rental agreements. I was happy to move out anyway. But it felt that me being an immigrant made for an easy target!

In 2018, my rental agency tried to scam me of 150£ for basic wear and tear and took me to the Deposit Protection Scheme whereas my other roommate wasn't, even though we both gave them the room in the same condition. I won the dispute but I thought they were making a soft target of me because of me being an immigrant they probably thought I wouldnt contest it.

In 2019, I took a break from work for a month and went back to India after the contract at my place ended. The plan was when I came back, my friend and I moved in together to a new place. He found a place but the landlord kept postponing signing the agreement. After a month of moving in, the guy wanted us to move out citing refurbishments as a reason. We threatened to go the police but some friends said its worthless without an agreement. We had a fierce argument on the phone but it didnt help. I wrote to the HMRC for tax evasion. Again, felt taken advantage of based on my situation.

<s>Also, in all these years, I have felt discriminated where available rooms go to local people and friends and rarely to immigrants, even though I agree to provide all proofs or even when I am ready to pay more. This is evident when the tenants change their decision to give the room to someone else without any valid reasons. This happened a few times.</s> Recently, I was in the position of having to find a tenant for my studio in Berlin and I realized why this happens.

There was this one occasion when I was at Arthur’s seat in Edinburgh, and an old woman approached me and asked me a few questions and talked about how they were losing jobs. But she was never impolite. I couldn't agree or disagree. I just couldnt explain where the world was moving to. So I just smiled and agreed.

Once after a late night out, I had to take my friend to her home as she was too drunk to walk. I had never been in such a situation before and I thought I couldnt just leave her there and decided to drop her at her home. She wasn't sober to even walk straight and I had to hold her. Some people in the station looked at me rather strangely and a lady asked me questions about where I was taking her. I explained her that I was only taking her to her home and I was going to my home after. She prayed to god in front of me which absolutely broke my heart. It was so stupid of me to have decided to take the tube and not catch a cab for her.

## Conclusion

I have come to realise that there is indeed a small degree of discrimination towards immigrants, towards people of color. But I am giving them the benifit of the doubt. Because would I face it if I moved to a different part in India? Probably yes. Would I discrimate someone based on my preconcieved notions? I probably have. It also has to do with the mindset of immigrants in general. Does everyone want to integrate with the society, live like a Roman when in Rome instead? I dont think so. And that is a problem.

Living there had its ups and downs, but eventually, when I look back, I miss the place. Corrie once said London will eventually get to you. I refuted it back then but I am beginning to realize she might have been right after all.
