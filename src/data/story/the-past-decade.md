# The past decade (2010 - 2020)

#### *01 Dec 2020, Berlin*

Amazing how I had just been thinking about this the other day and here was this question in Quora about the previous decacde. So I had to answer it.

It has been a topsy-turvy ride of so many ups and downs. Just like most people in middle class in India, I had my fair share of sheer struggle to get to the where I'm now.

**From Rural India to London**: My roots are from Ambasamudram which is a rural village in South India. From there my parents moved to New Delhi to Trivandrum. Thats where I grew up. In 2010, I was doing college here. I never saw myself as an achiever. I was just the average guy taking 2 public transport buses to the college and back. After that, I moved around India for a while before moving to London and then to Berlin and back to London. I have also travelled to about 15 countries, some of them solo.

**From dropping out to Lead Engineer**: In 2010, I hated Computer Science. All I could think of was playing cricket in a ground. From a school which laid emphasis on Physics, Mathematics, English etc, I saw Computer science as an outsider. Something like a co-curricular activity like the stitching classes. I struggled for a degree in college. Around the 6th semester, I was at the brink of dropping out. Many people wrote me off, I wrote myself off. I wouldnt blame them. I just didnt put my best foot forward. On an average, I wrote almost every one of the 52 papers in the engineering degree twice. Not because I was bad at it, but because I just didnt have the interest. Those days still haunt me. I think it was around 2011 at the age of 21 that I really matured as an adult and realised I had been taking my life for granted. I decided to be my own coach and I cleared 18 exams to pass out among my peers. Fast forward to 2020 - I am a Lead Engineer. I work with some of the best engineers in the world.

**From roadside eateries to Michelin restaurants:** There was a time when I was eating food from the road side eateries 2 times a day. Today, I cook my own food and occasionally visit some of the greatest restaurants in the world. My favourite is this Turkish restaurant called Cirrik in Dalston, London. I used to visit it every week with my friend. Whenever I visit London, I make sure to visit this place.

**From freelancer to founder**: In 2010, I was working for myself. I didn’t know what startups were. I was just working for random people as a freelancer still doing College. Entrepreneur was a word I couldn't even pronounce. I then tried to found a startup and failed, worked for a startup created by my college seniors, worked for Wipro, Nokia, Apple, Lloyds Bank and now I am at Delivery Hero, a fast growing Unicorn Start up. I have also set up jsDrome, a sole preoprietary business.

**Failure-fearing to failure-embracing**: Things didn’t come to me the easy way. Most things I learnt have been through a string of failures be it in my personal life of professional. I have realized that success is not about being in the comfort zone. It's to do well outside your comfort zone. Thats when you learn the most.

**Homeless to Penthouse** (not exactly a penthouse, but didn't get a better word to make it sound dramatic): In 2010, I lived with my parents. I remember the days when I used to have arguments at home as an immature child. In 2015, I lived in a house which didnt have water supply. 2020: I now live in my own studio apartment in a nice area in Berlin.

**Learner to teacher**: I changed from learning from others to teaching others.

**Final thoughts**: It’s not to say that I have succeeded in every aspect of life. I do have some way to go in my personal life but I think I have reached a reasonably good place in terms of my career, thanks to the risks I took in the last decade. I will end it by quoting an excerpt from my favourite poem, The road not taken by Robert Frost:

    I shall be telling this with a sigh
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.
