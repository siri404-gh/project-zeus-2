# Next big step in life

#### *02 June, 2021, Berlin*

&nbsp;

Today marks 4 things in my life.

**Firstly**, yesterday was my last day at work at Delivery Hero in Berlin. Great company, hyper growth unicorn start up, great engineers, greater people. Would absolutely won't think twice to working here in the future. And that means, I am officially unemployed now. Thankfully not for long.

**Secondly**, exactly this day 10 years ago, I started my first job for about 100$/month after almost dropping out of college. Fast forward today, a hobby project which I kept pursuing amidst fierce opposition has brought me a long way.

During this time, I learnt life the hard way. Facing hardships taught me how to tackle them, losing taught me how to win, made some amazing friends for life, made and broke from relationships, learnt to socialise, integrate and share, taught for free, travelled for cheap, cooked with less, learnt languages, cultures and histories and I worked for some great organisations which touch our lives everyday.

**Thirdly**, I am starting yet another phase in my life. After having worked in FinTech, EdTech and FoodTech, I have decided to take a turn to LoveTech. I have accepted a job as a Software Engineer @ Bumble in London. Its going to be amazing. Here, we encourage integrity, kindness, equality, confidence, and respect during all stages of any relationship. And this time, its different for me.

All this while, I had been just trying, running and seeking the next big thing. Here is where I think I should start living. Thats the life of an average Indian guy for you. In a rat race the day he is born.

But looking back in retrospect, there were some truly bleak moments, but the pieces of the puzzle are beginning to fall in place. Were everything acts of a guardian angel guiding me through the light? I dont know. Whatever they are, I am making the most of it while it lasts. As I climb another step in the ever ending societal ladder, I promise to give back, raise voice, help others and be humble more than ever.

**Lastly**, it just so happens to be my birthday. üéâü•≥
