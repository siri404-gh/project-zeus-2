# Next big step in life

#### *02 June, 2021, Berlin*

&nbsp;

Today marks 4 things in my life.

**Firstly**, yesterday was my last day at work at Delivery Hero in Berlin. Great company, hyper growth unicorn start up, great engineers, greater people. Wouldn't think twice to working here in the future. And that means, I am officially unemployed now. Thankfully not for long.

**Secondly**, exactly this day 10 years ago, I started my first job for about 100$/month after almost dropping out of college. Fast forward today, a hobby project which I kept pursuing amidst fierce opposition has brought me a long way. During this time, I learnt life through experience. I made some amazing friends for life, made and broke from relationships, learnt to socialise, integrate and share, taught for free, travelled for cheap, cooked with less, learnt languages, cultures and histories and I worked for some great organisations which genuinely work for the betterment of the world.

**Thirdly**, New Job ðŸ¥³. After having worked in FinTech, EdTech and FoodTech, I have decided to take a turn to LoveTech. I have accepted a job as a Software Engineer @ Bumble in London. The picture you see above is of the new office. Its going to be amazing, especially the free food. Here, we encourage integrity, kindness, equality, confidence, and respect during all stages of any relationship.

**Lastly**, it just so happens to be my birthday. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

All this while, I had been just trying and trying, steadfast in the relentless pursuit of the next big thing in life. Here is where I think I should stop running the rat race and start living.
