# Paragliding at Interlaken

#### *26 Jun 2017, Interlaken*


&nbsp;

This is one of my favourite pics. I saw the paragliding team at the base of Interlaken and I just decided at the spur of the moment that I will do it no matter what. They take you to the top of the mountain peak in a van and then prepare for the jump. It was a superb experience. Cost me a few meals though but it was worth every penny. Especially when you pass over the pine trees and do the 360 degree rotation on air. I was holding the camera and my glasses so that they dont fall off, lol. Unforgettable. Some day, I plan to get a paragliding license from here. Also seen is Martin Giller.
