# First month in Bumble

#### *01 Aug 2021, London*

&nbsp;

So its been a month in Bumble and just over a month in London for a second time. And here's my experience of it. Simply put, its **AMAZING**. It feels like I am going through the best time in my life everything I touch turning into gold. Here's my experience of it.

<br />

## Immigration

The company sponsored me a Skilled worker visa, set me up with their immigration team at Newland Chase who did everything for me. The travel team booked all the flights and hotel transfers. Super easy and very professional. The whole experience was a breeze.

## Accommodation

I was put up at Leman Locke in Aldgate initially for a month. A 4-star apartment in the 16th floor right at the heart of the city like the picture shown here was a perfect start to my second term in London. I loved the design of the house, especially the kitchen. It had everything designed perfectly in a small space. Work of art! I underwent quarantine for 10 days and the people there were super helpful because I couldnt go out of my room. Big shout out to them. Will use their services again.

Later I moved on to an apartment of my own.

## The Team

The thing with people in tech start ups is they are the world's best minds and are humble at the same time. They put me at ease very quickly. I work in Bumble's Design team as a Senior Frontend Engineer in the team of [Cristiano Rastelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didoo/) who spearheaded the adaptation of it at Bumble. Design systems are the core of the UI in any application. When done right, it can work wonders. Here, we are a horizontal service which maintains the design system and all the toolings around it for all teams across the organisation.

## The Perks

As someone put it in our slack channels, its **flabbergasting** to say the least. The list is huge from extravagant parties to staycations in cruise ships and the company keeps revising it to adding more to it every month. I have compiled a list of 54 items in an excel sheet to not miss out on anything but here is a section of it from the official website - [https://team.bumble.com/benefits/london](https://team.bumble.com/benefits/london). I was out testing our application in the wild and it does work. I met someone and went out on a few dates. More on that later.

Recently, it was announced that we will be given unlimited paid time off with Manager's approval. I mean thats just genuine trust, right? I can honestly say that it doesnt feel like I'm "working" for someone, I am just - doing the things I love doing for a great cause Bumble stands for.
