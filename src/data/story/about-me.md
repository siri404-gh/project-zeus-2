## Hello, I am Sreeram! ðŸ‘‹

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

&nbsp;

Hi there! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Web Developer. I work for Bumble in London. I consider myself an artist in the world of web painting it with the colors of Javascript with a touch of creativity. I'm an ambitious guy moving steadfast towards my goal.

Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great companies amongst some of the best engineering minds in the world. I will be sharing anecdotes of the experiences I have had and the impact it has had in my life.

Also, in doing so, I have attended over 100 interviews. A section of this website is dedicated to me sharing the challenges I faced in each of these and I think it will be super helpful for any aspiring Web Developer. If only one gets inspired, it's a victory.

Outside of work, I'm generally a friendly, easy going, down-to-earth, relatively mature, respectable, someone you can rely on, talk about anything - life, politics, movies or whatever. I am also a part-time teacher teaching people programming online and also an amateur photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered about 15 countries. I try to spend summers in Europe and winters in India. I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. I used to play a lot of cricket until injuries forced me out of it. Also, I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial.
