## Hello, I am Sreeram!ðŸ‘‹

Hi there reader! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Sofware Engineer/Web Developer. The web is my world and I consider myself an artist in it painting it with the colors of Javascript with a touch of creativity.

I live in London and work for Bumble. Prior to that, I worked for Delivery Hero in Berlin and Wipro Technologies in various parts of India working in projects involving Nokia, Apple and Lloyds Banking Group.

Outside of work, I am generally a friendly, laid back, down-to-earth and reserved person. Not the most exciting, nor the most boring.

I am also a teacher teaching people programming online during my free time and an amateur photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered about 15 countries. I am learning to cook. Mostly Indian, but expanding my repertoire. I speak about 4-6 languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too.

Here, I write about things I find interesting - the places I visit, the things I learn, the people I meet, the photos I take, the food I have, the decisions I take, and many other things. If even one gets inspired, its a victory.
