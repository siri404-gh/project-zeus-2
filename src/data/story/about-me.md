## Hello, I am Sreeram! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Web Developer. I work for Bumble in London. I consider myself an artist in the world of web painting it with the brushes of Javascript and the colors of creativity. 

This is my personal website. Here, I write about things I find interesting - the places I visit, the things I learn, the people I meet etc. There is also a premium section where I share real world interview experiences I have had over the years. Over the past 10 years, I have attended over 100 interviews and I think it will be super helpful for any aspring Web Developer.

Mostly Indian, but expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak about 4-6 languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too.
