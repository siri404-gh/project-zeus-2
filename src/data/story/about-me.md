## Hello, I am Sreeram! ðŸ‘‹

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

&nbsp;

Hi there! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Web Developer from India. I work for Bumble in London. I consider myself an artist in the world of web painting it with the colors of Javascript with a touch of creativity.

This is my personal website. Here, I write about things I find interesting - the places I visit, the things I learn, the people I meet etc.

Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great companies. I will be sharing anecdotes of the experiences I have had and the impact it has had in my life. I believe that if only one gets inspired, it's a victory.

Also, in doing so, I have attended over 100 interviews. I will sharing the challenges and questions I faced in each of these without revealing the names of the companies (as I have signed a non disclosure agreements) and I think it will be super helpful for any aspiring Web Developer.

Outside of work, I am generally a friendly, laid back, down-to-earth and easily approachable person. I am also a part-time teacher teaching people programming online and also an amateur photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered about 15 countries. I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. I tend to have strong opinions on Socio-political issues around the world.
