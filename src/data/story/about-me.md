## Hello, I am Sreeram!ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Sofware Engineer/Web Developer. The web is my world and I consider myself an artist in it painting it with the colors of JavaScript with a touch of creativity.

I work for Delivery Hero in Berlin. Previously, I worked for Wipro Digital in various parts of India working in projects involving Nokia and Apple before moving to London to work for Lloyds Banking Group where I spent 3 years.

Outside of work, I am generally a friendly, laid back, down-to-earth and easily approachable person.

I am also a teacher teaching people programming online during my free time and as well as an amateur photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered about 15 countries. I am learning to cook. Mostly Indian, but expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak about 4-6 languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too.

Here, I write about things I find interesting - the places I visit, the things I learn, the people I meet etc. There is also a premium section where I share technical stuff I learnt over the years.
