## Hello, I am Sreeram! ðŸ‘‹

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

&nbsp;

Hi there! I am Sreeram. I am a Web Developer. I work for Bumble in London. I consider myself an artist in the world of web painting it with the colors of Javascript with a touch of creativity.

Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great companies amongst some of the best engineering minds in the world. I will be sharing anecdotes of the experiences I have had and the impact it has had in my life.

Outside of work, I am also a student Pilot enroute getting my pilots license. Its the high octane activity which takes my mind away from code and computers sometimes. I have a keen interest in teaching. I am a part-time teacher teaching people programming online sometimes. I travel regularly and have so far been to about 15 countries. I try to spend summers in Europe visiting my friends there and winters in India where my parents are. I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. I used to play a lot of cricket until injuries forced me out of it and I am in the process of getting back into it. I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial. Lastly, I'm generally a friendly, easy going, down-to-earth, respectable, someone you can rely on, talk about anything - life, politics, movies or whatever. I am meticulous and abmitious and I move steadfast towards my goals.
