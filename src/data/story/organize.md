# How I organize my life

#### *01 Jan 2021, Berlin*

Before you read this, let me clear up one thing. I am a Web Developer. I spend a part of my life creating things in the virtual world. I also have a social life. The margins between them are narrow. And I know it very well.

Over the past decade, my life changed drastically and quick. I realized that my life had become very fast paced and haphazard. In trying to succeed, I had been forgetting to live. Changing 3 countries in a matter of 5 years didnt help either. There was always something to do which I kept forgetting. There were too many repetitive and mundane tasks which took up a lot of my time, like changing houses, filing taxes, making payments, changing passwords, etc and that too, in different countries. I started to feel I was missing out on the important things in life, I started to forget things. Something kept lingering in the back of my mind and I didnt know what. It was just utter chaos. It was consuming so much of my time in a day.

So, as a Software Engineer in a reputable organisation, I decided to take action because if there is anything we are good at, its time, space and people management. In addition to this is Money management. Its not about saving. Its about knowing where to spend and how much.

Over the past year, I had been prioritizing my things and taking notes on them. And I realized there are actually only a handful of important categories in life where I spent most of my time on. I organized and arranged all my **Devices, Folders, Emails, Bookmarks, Documents, Apps, Notes and Reminders** into these categories. This helped me prioritize things, not to forget them and not to miss out on any of them. All of their data is securely backedup the cloud and that means all of them are always in sync.

For example,
- All my bookmarks and email filters are divided into categories. So I know where to go if I need to find something.
- All my documents are stored in the cloud in Google Drive or Dropbox and their softwares ensure that a synced copy of it always exists on my laptop/phone.
- All the photos I take on my phone are backed up into Google Photos automatically.
- All my passwords are managed by the Google Password Manager.
- All my work takes place in the Cloud (Codespaces).
- All the deadlines and important dates are in my Reminder.
- All my important notes are in Google Notes

Its like my life is safely and securely backed up in the cloud and all the apps and devices work for me in keeping everything organized. Even if I lose my phone or laptop, I do not have to worry about losing my data. And this has been truly liberating.

So here are the categories of my life:

**Accommodation** - Addresses, rental contracts, login portals, emails, documents, disputes etc.

**Accounts** - All online accounts, mobile accounts in various countries which hold my data.

**Business** - Documents, mails, reports, apps pertaining to my businesses go in here.

**Career** - Job search/applications go here from LinkedIn, Monster, Stackoverflow, Naukri.

**Entertainment** - Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, BBC iPlayer.

**Family** - Everything pertaining to my loved ones including friends and relatives.

**Finance** - Mostly bank accounts in various countries.

**Food** - Food delivery applications, receipts etc.

**Health** - Health applications, reports, doctor appointments.

**Invest** - Fixed Deposts, Insurances, Share market holdings.

**Learn** - All online learning apps, websites etc go in here. For example, Leetcode, Coursera etc.

**Lifestyle**

**Listen** - Podcasts, Audible e-books.

**Music** - Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Youtube music.

**Organize** - Google Keep, Google Passwords, Google Calendar, Apple reminders.

**Social** - Social Media apps/websites.

**Storage** - Google Drive, Dropbox, One drive, iCloud drive, Box.

**Tax** - India Tax, UK Tax, Germany Tax.

**Travel** - Flight tickets, train tickets, itineraries.

**Visa** - Visa portals, applications.

**Work** - Work applications/webites/documents.

## Daily routine

With everything organized, it became easier to follow my daily routine which is as below.

- **0730** - Wake up.
- **0800** - Work out.
- **0900** - Get to Work. Podcasts on the way.
- **0930** - Breakfast.
- **1300** - Lunch.
- **1800** - Get back home. Podcasts on the way.
- **1900** - Learn. Coursera/Leetcode.
- **2000** - Cook/Dinner.
- **2100** - Work on my business.
- **2300** - Read.
- **0000** - Sleep.

Following this strictly is very hard, impossible on some days. I do make some compromises when there are more important things to do. Like going out, social gatherings, family time or just to watch TV or listen to music. But I try to follow this as much as I can. And without this clearing of clutter, I am like a headless chicken.
