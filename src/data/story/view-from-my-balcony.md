# The view from my balcony in India

#### *09 Sep 2014, Trivandrum, India*

Seen above is the view from my home in Trivandrum. On a typical sunny day, it looks as if the heavens have descended on earth. I live in the 9th floor of a 12-floor apartment which is the only high rising apartment in the area which brings the cool breeze from all directions.

This is only part of the view, on the other side, one can see the city, the sea, the mountains and important landmarks.

Trivandrum is an amazing city to live. Its green, clean, costal, with thriving, progressive, literate society and an emerging tech crowd. Its also safe for women than many other cities in India.

Its also the capital of the most literate state in India.
