# My experience of moving out of Germany

#### *25 Jul 2021, London*

&nbsp;

I came to Berlin from London on July 2019 to work for Delivery Hero. Moved back to London on July 2021. And moving out of Germany is as tough a task as moving in, if not tougher. Here's my experience of it.

**Resignation from work** - Handed my notice 3 months prior. My last day at my previous company was 31 May. Downloaded all payslips and Lohnsteuerbescheinigung.

**Cancelling Health Insurance** - Handed in notice a months prior to moving out. They asked for the dregistration proof but were okay with flight tickets and the health insurance number from the country I was moving to. I gave them my National Insurance number from the UK because thats where I was going to and I had been there before so I had the number when they asked for it.

**Moving out of apartment** - Handed my notice 3 months prior to moving out by email. Conducted online viewings for about 150 people and physical viewings for 10. Landlord eventually decided to not rent it but refurbish it instead. Had to sell everything in the last 2 weeks. Had trouble getting the hauswerwaltung to respond to emails but they did after reminders.

**Selling all furniture** - I sold all my furniture on Facebook marketplace and some facebook groups such as Free your stuff Berlin. Some things sold like hot cakes, some at low cost, some for free and some never got sold at all.

**Viewings during pandemic time** - I had about 150 people interested in the apartment. But because it was during the lockdown period, I couldn't have them come to the apartment. So I conducted online viewings in batches of 20 for a week using Google Meet.

**Abmeldung** - Read in the Berlin Expats group in Facebook posted by someone that it can be done **only** a week before moving out. Deposited my letter at the Burgeramt Neukolln office exactly a week before moving out. But I never heard from them. Eventually I ran out of patience and emailed them a month after moving out. I got their email from the berlin.de website. They replied after 10 days and asked for a new copy of the deregistration form and a copy of my passport. Attached them both to my reply to the email. Got done the next day. They attached the soft copy to the email and posted me the hard copy to the new address in the UK. ðŸ¤¦

**Electricity** - Handed notice 3 months prior to moving out by email. They asked for meter reading, new address and date of handing over of keys. Looks like handing notice wasn't needed. They paid back the extra amount I paid for. Now, they were customer friendly. Thank you Vattenfall. As a single person in a 28sqm apartment, I spent abut 1000kwH of energy in 1.5 years.

**Radio** - Did the cancellation online. Needed abmeldung letter for it. Got the receipt. Yet to get the confirmation letter posted to my address.

**WiFi** - Read in the Berlin Expats Facebook group that abmeldung was required to invoke the extraordinary cancellation as I had signed a 2 year contract with them. So I waited till the last week to get the abmeldung confirmation. But because abmeldung was effed up, with 2 days to go in the country, I went to their store myself to tell them about my moving. They started the termination process on 20 June but it would completely take effect only on 20 September because I had to pay for 3 extra months for nothing. Also couriered them the router. My mistake was thinking I needed the abmeldung to do this. I could have handed the notice in April. I will not use Vodafone's services again.

**Tax Returns** - Emailed the finanzamt to use my email for all future correspondence. Had to sign a GDPR thing in return. But they wouldn't email tax return confirmation due to their tax secrecy policies, they only post them. The actual tax return has been in progress since May. Not sure whats taking them so long. Hard to get them to respond to emails.

**Post Forwarding (Nachsendeantrag)** - Had to do it 5 days prior to moving out. Any letter for me to that address will be forwarded to my new address.

**Bank Accounts** - Closed DB based on their advice. Kept N26 open as I am happy with their service.

**Pention Contributions** - Will claim it back after 2 years.

**Blue Card** - I think it will remain valid for upto 1 year after to moving out. I'm not exactly sure how this works, need to find out.

All in all, its a tedious process. The country has a long way to go in terms of adopting Digital tools. But I'm glad I didnt leave anything hanging in Germany.
