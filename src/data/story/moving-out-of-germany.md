# My experience of moving out of Germany

#### *25 Jul 2021, London*

&nbsp;

Came to Berlin in 2019. Moved out on 21 June 2021.

**Resignation** - Handed my notice 3 months prior. My last day at my previous company was 31 May. Downloaded all payslips and Lohnsteuerbescheinigung.

**Health Insurance** - Canceled it a month prior to moving out email. They asked for flight tickets.

**Moving out** - Handed my notice 3 months prior to moving out by email. Conducted online viewings for about 150 people. Landlord decides to not rent it but refurbish it instead. Had to sell everything in the last 2 weeks. Had trouble getting the hauswerwaltung to respond to emails but they did after reminders.
Abmeldung - Read in this group that it can be done latest a week before moving out. Deposited my letter at the Burgeramt Neukolln office a week before moving out. Never heard from them. I emailed them on 20 July. They asked for copy of passport. Was done the next day.

**Electricity** - Handed notice 3 months prior to moving out by email. They asked for meter reading, new address and date of handing over of keys. Looks like handing notice wasn't needed. They paid back the extra amount I paid for.

**Radio** - Did the cancellation online. Needed abmeldung letter for it. Yet to get the confirmation

**Wifi** - Read in this group that abmeldung was required to invoke the extraordinary cancellation as I had signed a 2 year contract with them. So I waited till the last week to get the abmeldung confirmation. But because abmeldung was effed up, I went to their store myself to tell them about my moving. They started the termination process which would take effect only on 20 September. Ended up paying about 220â‚¬ extra for nothing. I cant name the provider because you usually get sued for complaining but their name starts with V. Also couriered them the router.

**Tax Returns** - Mailed finanzamt to use my email for all future correspondence. Had to sign a GDPR thing. But they wouldnt email tax return confirmations. They only post them. Actual tax return in progress since May. Hard to get them to respond to emails.

**Post Forwarding (Nachsendeantrag)** - Had to do it 5 days prior to moving out.

**Bank Accounts** - Closed DB based on their advice. Kept N26 open as I am happy with them.
