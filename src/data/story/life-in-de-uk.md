# Life in IN, Germany and UK

#### *30 Nov 2020, Berlin*

&nbsp;

## Background

The following abbreviations will be used in this post: **IN** - India **DE** - Germany **UK** - United Kingdom

I lived in IN for the first 25 years, moved to the UK where I lived for 3 years and then to DE where I lived for 2 years. I then decided to move back the UK.

## Points of comparison

If I were to compare 3 countries, I would compare them based on the following criteria.

**Monatary** - Where do I get the most value for my contribution? Obviously this will be better in the UK or EU. Maybe in IN in the future. But at the moment, its the UK. 0-0-1 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Social** - I found UK to me much more receptive to Indians than DE. This is probably due to the shared history between the countries. And IN would have been cake walk. When I was in DE, besides some of the professional connections I made, my social life took a hit. It was because of the language barrier I had there. Also, Berlin is not the place to make friends. Everybody is from somewhere going somewhere and its hard to break the ice or make long term connections. It is not just my opinion but is a point that is discussed extensively in Berlin amongst the expat community. IN or UK would be the best bet for it. 1-0-2 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Beuraucratic** - I had issues navigating through the German system. They had some of the weirdest laws I have ever come across. They served a purpose, sure. But for an immigrant expat to get used to them would take a decade. I didn't have that time. I got this constant feeling that someone was watching over me waiting for me to make a wrong move to penalize me. And being the dark about most things disconnected me from the system. I do not like to live like that. While in the UK, it was so much easier to navigate through it. In IN, it has always been cumbursome, but I knew my way around it. 2-0-3 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Career** - In the field that I am in, which is a shortage occupation across the world, any country would have been good for my career. 3-1-4 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Ease of life** - UK would be so much easier for me to live especially since I have lived there before. Life in IN would have been okay, but difficult. 3-1-5 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Travel** - DE being in the center of Europe, it would have enabled me to travel many countries in Europe and Asia. It will be slightly more difficult in the UK. 3-2-5 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Closeness to parents** - It would be equally easy for me to visit them once or twice a year from the UK or DE. But not as easy as from IN. This is something I am trying to fix by make a single long visit or 2 short visits to IN every year. 4-2-5 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Raising a family** - The healthcare is free in both UK and DE. The German pension system was good. Education, including university is free in DE. In the UK, I'd have to pay for college, and pay for a private pension scheme. All in all, UK and DE would be better to raise a family. 4-3-6 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

## Conclusion

DE would have been good had it not been for the pandemic and after an initial struggle of 5-6 years. But because I dont have that time, I have chosen to go the UK yet again. It feels like the more natural place for Indians to go. But I am happy I got to learn DE for 2 years.
