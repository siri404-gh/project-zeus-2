# Why I chose a life in DE over IN and UK

#### *23 August, 2020, Berlin*

This question runs in my mind every day. Itâ€™s my greatest dilemma. It could turn out to be my biggest regret if I donâ€™t take the right decisions in the coming years. Ever since 2012, I have been moving cities. Ever since 2016, I have been moving countries. What next? What am I leaving behind? My answer is based on my experience at 30 while I am still single.

Towards the end of 2019, I had 3 things in my hand. A job in Germany with a fat paycheck, a job in India with a fat paycheck and an option to continue living in the UK with a not so fat a check until 2022. Everything seemed good. I had to choose one.

Its difficult to give a straight answer to this question. There are pros and cons in path you choose. The answer depends on what one wants at what certain stage in his life. I will touch upon a few decisions I made.

## The questions that went through my head

  - Which one do I choose?
  - A job that gets me $50K in Bangalore? $60K in London Or $90-100K in Berlin?
  - A life at home or a life somewhere else?
  - A life where I am with my loved ones or a life where I'm alone?
  - A safe, boring life or an adventurous, tumultuous life?
  - A life where I countribute to your country or a life where I contribute to the world?

I considered the following things.

**Monetary gains** - Everyone who says money isn't anything is just plain stupid. Its a means of quantifying your contribution to the society. At the same time, not using the money you make is stupid. At the time I made the decision, I would have made almost the same money after taxes in all 3 countries. But I knew that the money I make will grow rapidly in Germany. So, 0â€“1-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Career growth** - This seemed to better in DE with many developed countries fighting for the best talent out there. With the Blue card, I can travel and work in any EU country. In the UK or IN, this wouldnt have been possible. Also, post covid, with remote working options, a job in DE meant I could move freely anywhere in the world (with a tourist visa). And with a PR in just 2 years, I will be perfectly poised for a borderless life. This wouldn't have been possible in other countres. 0â€“2-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Value to society** - I am of better value to India. But Germany is of better value to me in terms of my contribution to the world and the life I'd get for it. 0â€“3-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Happiness** - I lose precious time I could have been with my friends, relatives and parents in India and that has been a source of some regrets. 1â€“2-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Business plans** - My long term plan is to setup my own business. This would have been tough had I been in India because there will not have been enough spare money to set a business up nor the time. Today I have a sole proprietary business which employs 1 student and I am planning to scale it. This is only because I am outside India. I dont think I would even think about it in India. I will give equal points to DE and UK. 1â€“3-1 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Social Integration** - This is a big factor. In Germany I have a tough time integrating with the crowd simply because I can't speak the language. Since English is the only language I speak, write and code, it would have been much easier for me to set up a social circle in IN or UK. Since this is the biggest problem I will face in Germany, I will reward 2 points for the other countries. 3â€“4-3 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Life experiences** - You cant put a price tag on lifeâ€™s lessons. Being on my own in foriegn countries, I have done and learnt so much on my own which will help me for the rest of my life. The experience I'd gain from: meeting new people, learning a new language, learning their history and cultures, living alone, cooking for myself, facing new issues, paying multiple taxes, flying business class, missing flights, negotiating rent, driving right side, going on a blind date, trying a new religion, new food etc to say the least, is the spice I needed in my life. I will give equal points to UK and DE here. 3-5-4 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

**Society, Safety, Pollution, Education, Healthcare** - The people are of progressive mentality in cities like London and Berlin. Everyone is equal, nobody is judged, the government works for them. Safety standards vary from state to state in India. Although Trivandrum, where I'm from, is much better than most other places in India, they are even better in the UK or DE. Pollution is less. Education is free in UK and DE. College is free in DE. Healthcare is the same in both places. So, 3-6-5 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§

## Conclusion

It was a tough decision to make. But due to the visa restrictions in the UK and the opportunities in DE I thought, why not free up my wings, let the world know of my existence, make hay while the sun still shines? Any why not especially my job pays for it. So I decided to move to Berlin ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª

## Will I be back in India?

I try to make 2 trips to India every year. I am working towards increasing the frequency. Where I will finally settle is still not clear.
