# The majestic view of the Shard

#### *28 Dec 2016, Tower Bridge, London*

I had a 10 day London Pass to spend on 60 tourist destinations in London. On the 28th of December, just days before 2017, I went to the Tower Bridge. I was with a friend, Vignesh and this pic was shot with his Camera. I must have shot a 100 photos standing at there trying to get the perfect short without any blur. After about an hour, I got this. Seen on the left is London's tallest building, the Shard. Seen on the thames is HMS Belfast, a retired warship and on the right is the Walkie-talkie tower. You can also see the St Pauls Cathedral, the BT Tower and the London Eye in the distance.

London will forever by my favourite place.
