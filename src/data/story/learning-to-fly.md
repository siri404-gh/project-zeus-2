# Next adventure - Flying

#### *04 Sep 2021, London*

Being a pilot was my childhood dream. So much so that I still look up at the sky as a plane passes over. And so last week, as I laid on my sofa thinking about what next, I decided to move my rears for a change and hit the skies, join a flyng school and hopefully get a Private Pilot's License. I do tend to take these spur-of-the-moment decisions.

It was my first class. I went to Redhill Aerodrome. I flew for about an hour. I flew a Cessna 152 the picture of it is what you see above. There was an insturctor of course. But I took the controls for about half of the journey. It was a thrilling ride.

I had a nice instructor in Randy who put me at ease every quickly. Before taking off, he gave me a briefing about how the aircraft works. How the wings work, the tail, the rudder, emergency landing instructions etc.

As we got to about 1500m above sea level, just under the clouds, he let me have a go of the plane. Wow! It was a one of a kind experience. It was almost like driving a car except you have a whole new dimension to take care of. The turnings were scary. Occasionally we lost altitude because I didnt know to what degree to turn the steering. It will take me a few hours of practice for sure but I feel confident. After a while, I just wanted to give him back the controls and enjoy the view of Surrey. Was not the greatest of days, but I was able to get a few shots.

Finishing the course can take upto 2 years and make my wallet a lot lighter, but I am convinced it will be worth it. Cant wait for my second class.
