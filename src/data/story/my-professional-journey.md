## 2005-07 Blogger days

The story unfolds in 2005 when my friends at school created an online forum for my class which created a buzz. It was used for all the class discussions/gossips. They also monetized it using Google Adsense. Although being new to computers, I was excited about what they did and wanted to do it myself. Thats when I found Blogger. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasn't very popular. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development.

## 2007-11 The Z Axis Challenge

It wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an Online treasure hunt game (something like a quiz where you couldn't just search google to find the answer, but had to think out of the box, solve puzzles etc) and surprizingly, I did well that I finished 7th in the contest which was played by thousands of students across the country. I was so hooked up by it that I wanted to build it for my own college. So I built the Z Axis Challenge. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypting them using a software with the answer as the password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it was an epic failure. So I decided to do it properly and got in touch with the guys who created that game. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could do it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn it. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP and ended up creating a basic version of the game for my college. And voila, it was well received. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure how I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. Then, I started to conduct this game independently on my own. They were all reasonably good successes. Back in those days, Web development was not considered a mainstream job.

## 2011-12 - First gig

I used to attend Web Development contests throughout my final 2 years of college which I'd mostly win. I remember the days when I would be travelling in a bus with a note in my hand with the all the syntaxes like links, script tags etc which I would memorize. My friends took turns to be my partner and we split the prize money. In 2011, I was asked to create the website for RAICS - an International IEEE conference on the Recent Advancements in Intelligent Computing Systems.

## 2012 - First job, first start-up

In June 2011, I joined **Mistallianz** at Trivandrum, a startup where I worked as a PHP Developer for 6 months while also studying in college. Towards the end of 2011, I started and failed in creating my own start up called* vyakthitva.com* (vyakthitva stands for individuality in Sanskrit). An online platform where people can create their portfolio/resume/website and recruiters can search and find them. I ended it abrupty because I wasnt fully convinced with it. Also, I had to move to Cochin for a new job.

## 2012-16 - Career in Wipro

So in 2012, I joined **Wipro Technologies** as a Software Engineer. Throughout school and college, I hated computer science to the core. I think I didnt understand its beauty coupled with Mathematics. But through some outworldly intervention, I did well in the 3 month rigorous training where I found Unix and C very interesting. I finished in the top 5 in a class of 23 for a guy who absolutely didnt know or like Computer Science or programming until just 3 months prior to that. Although I was a C developer initially, I found my own opportunity in Web Development in a different location for a different client. So I moved to Chennai to work for Apple. I also made frequent official visits to Bangalore. Loved those all-paid-for trips.

## 2016-19 - Moving to London

In 2016, I was deputed by Wipro to London to work for **Lloyds Banking Group**. The work there was challenging. Suddenly, from a Junior developer in offshore, I was put into a role where had to take major decisions for the Statements team as a Frontend Lead, a page used by millions in the UK every single day. That was daunting. So many ups and downs but it was the best time of my life. I made some great friends and connections which I will cherish for the rest of my life. Amazing people! In 2017, I travelled all around Europe solo just to come out of my comfort zone.

## 2019-21 - Moving to Berin

I moved to Berlin in 2019 for yet another adventure to work for **Delivery Hero** to take up a Tech lead position. I worked there for 2 years. It was a great company and I worked with some of the best engineers in the world. Made some great friends from various parts of the world who I wouldn't have met otherwise. Thats one of the perks of working in a Unicorn startup I guess.

## 2021 - Moving back to London

The pandemic had a rather negative impact on me trying to set up a new life in a new country. Anyway, it is about to get over and I decided that it was time to make another move. I looked at a potential few countries in Europe and Asia and, after much deliberation, I decided to go back to London. I will be working for **Bumble** as a Software Engineer. This means that I will have to give up on my EU citizenship which I was so close to getting. I wish brexit and the pandemic hadn't happened.
