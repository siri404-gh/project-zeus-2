# Next big step in life

#### *02 June 2021, Berlin*

&nbsp;

This eventful week marks 4 things in my life.

**Firstly**, Monday was my last day at work at Delivery Hero in Berlin. After working for almost 2 years, I decided to turn to greener pastures. Great company, hyper growth unicorn start up, great engineers, greater people. Wouldn't think twice to working here in the future. And that means, I am officially unemployed now. Thankfully not for long.

**Secondly**, on Tuesday 10 years ago, I started my first job for about 100$/month while still doing college. During these 10 years, I made some amazing friends for life, learnt to socialise, integrate and share, taught for free, travelled for cheap, cooked with less, learnt languages, cultures and histories and I worked for some great organisations which genuinely work for the betterment of the world.

**Thirdly**, Wednesday just happens to be my birthday. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

**Lastly**, New job ðŸ¥³. After having worked in FinTech, EdTech and FoodTech, I have decided to take a turn to LoveTech. I have accepted a job as a Software Engineer @ Bumble in London. The picture you see above is of the new office. Here, we encourage integrity, kindness, equality, confidence, and respect during all stages of any relationship. Its going to be amazing.

All this while, I had been just trying and trying, steadfast in the relentless pursuit of the next big thing in life. Here is where I think I should stop running the rat race and start living.
