# Next big step in life

#### *02 Jun 2021, Berlin*

&nbsp;

This eventful week marks 4 things in my life.

**Firstly**, Monday was my last day at work at Delivery Hero in Berlin. After working for almost 2 years, I decided to turn to greener pastures. Great company, hyper growth unicorn start up, great engineers, greater people. Wouldn't think twice to working here in the future. And that means, I am officially unemployed now. Thankfully not for long.

**Secondly**, on Tuesday 10 years ago, I started my first job for about 100$/month while still doing college. During these 10 years, I made some amazing friends for life, learnt to socialise, integrate and share, taught for free, travelled for cheap, cooked with less, learnt languages, cultures and histories and I worked for some great organisations which genuinely work for the betterment of the world.

**Thirdly**, New job ðŸŽ‰. After having worked in FinTech, EdTech and FoodTech, I have decided to take a turn to LoveTech. I have accepted a job as a Software Engineer @ Bumble in London. The picture you see above is of the new office. Here, we encourage integrity, kindness, equality, confidence, and respect during all stages of any relationship. Its going to be amazing.

In 2019, when I took the decision to leave London for Berlin, the pandemic was looming round the corner. As it went on wreaking havoc, here I was living a life in solitude not exposed to it. And now, as fate would have it, just as we see the light at the end of the tunnel, I am leaving Berlin for London. It is as if I came to Germany just to live a life of exile while the pandemic went on its rage spree elsewhere. Maybe there is a guardian angel is looking after me.

**Lastly**, Wednesday just happens to be my birthday. ðŸ¥³

To conclude, all this while, I had been just trying and trying, steadfast in the relentless pursuit of the next big thing in life. Thats the life of a quintessential Indian. Born to compete. And I wont complain, because our parents had to ensure our survival in a country of a billion. But here is where I think I should stop running and start living.
