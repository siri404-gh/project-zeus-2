# 1. Two Sum

#### 12 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

## Problem

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Solution

```js
const twoSum = (arr, target) => {
  const map = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const curr = arr[i];
    const comp = target - curr;
    if (comp in map) return [i, map[comp]];
    map[curr] = i;
  }

  return [];
}
```

## Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
