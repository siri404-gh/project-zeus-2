# 20. Valid Parentheses

#### 12 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

## Problem

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets; Open brackets must be closed in the correct order; Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

## Solution

```js
const isValid = str => {
  const comp = {
    "}": "{",
    "]": "[",
    ")": "("
  };

  let stack = [];

  str.forEach((s, i) => {
    if (comp[s] && stack[stack.length - 1] === comp[s])
      stack.pop();
    else stack.push(s);
  });
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

## Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
