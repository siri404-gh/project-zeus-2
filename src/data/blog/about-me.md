# Hello, I am Sreeram!

#### *01 June, 2021, Berlin*

Hi there reader! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Sree or Siri. I am a Sofware Engineer and this is my personal website. I consider myself an artist of the web, perfectionist engineering the web using JavaScript. I emphasise on creativity, time management and efficiency. I live in London and work for Bumble. Prior to that, I worked for Delivery Hero in Berlin and Wipro Technologies in Bangalore/Chennai/Kochi working in projects involving Nokia, Apple and Lloyds Banking Group.

Outside of work, I am generally a friendly, laid back, down-to-earth and reserved person. I am not the most exciting, but not the boring type either. I think I am whatever you are.

I am also a teacher teaching people programming online during my free time and an amateur photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered about 15 countries. I am learning to cook. I mostly cook Indian. I speak about 4-6 languages - ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç (Tamil), ‡¥Æ‡¥≤‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥≥‡¥Ç (Malayalam), ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi), and English. I had learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too.

Here, I write about things I find interesting - the places I visit, the things I learn, the people I meet, the photos I take, the food I have, the decisions I take, and many other things. If even one gets inspired, its a victory.
