# Hello, I am Sreeram!

#### *07 August, 2020, London*

Hi there reader! I am Sreeram. Friends call me Siri or Sree. I am a Web Engineer and this is my personal website. I am a Frontend Tech Lead at Delivery Hero in Berlin, Germany. I am also the founder of jsDrome. I am also a trainer and a photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered 14 countries and several cities. I will be covering a lot more over the next years.

I consider myself an artist of the web, perfectionist engineering the web using JavaScript. I emphasise on creativity, time management and efficiency.

This is my personal website. I write about things I find interesting, the places I visit, the people I meet, the photos I take, the food I cook, the cuisines I try, the decisions I take, and many other things. I belive that if even one gets inspired, its a victory.

## Get in touch

If you'd like to work with me/attend my trainings/seek career advice/have a coffee, just find me at LinkedIn or Instagram at @sreeramofficial.

*Dankesch√∂n!*
