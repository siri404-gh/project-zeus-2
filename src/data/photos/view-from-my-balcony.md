# The view from my balcony

#### *09 Sep 2020, Trivandrum, India*

&nbsp;

Seen above is the view from my home in Trivandrum. On a typical sunny day, it looks as if the heavens have descended on earth. I live in the 9th floor of a 12-floor apartment which is the only high rising apartment in the area which brings the cool breeze from all directions.

This is only part of the view, on the other side, one can see the city, the sea, the mountains and important landmarks.

Trivandrum is an amazing city to live. Its near to the southern tip of India. Its green, clean, costal, with thriving, progressive, literate society and an emerging tech scene. There is an international airport there, World heritage sites and its home to the world's richest temple. Its also the capital of the most literate state in India.
