# Trip to the top of Scotland

#### *24 Apr 2017, Edinburgh*


&nbsp;

Seen above is the view from the top of Arthur's seat in Edinburgh, Scotland. Taken in April 2017, this was my 4th trip solo to a capital city.

This trip was an especially tough one for me because I wanted to do it solo. To get out of my comfort zone. And I did. I made the overnight journey to Edinburgh. I walked all the way to Hollyrood park which is just a few miles away from the city centre, the Edinburgh Waverley. From there, its about a half an hour's climb to the top of the mountain.

On a spectacularly sunny day, which luckily was the case that day, I was treated to this amazing view. I felt like I was on top of the world. There was not a single soul around. Just me at the edge of the world and my thoughts. The cool breeze hit me like I've achieved something. 25 years of hardship to reach this peak, literally and metaphorically.

Here's an excerpt from a song to discribe it:

    Such a feelin's comin' over me
    There's wonder in 'most every thing I see
    Not a cloud in the sky,
    Got the sun in my eyes
    And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
    Everything I want the world to be
    Is now comin' true especially for me
    And the reason is clear,
    It's because you are here
    You're the nearest thing to heaven -
    That I've seen
    I'm on the top of the world lookin'
    Down on creation
    And the only explanation I can find..
