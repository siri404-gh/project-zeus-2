## Locus 2019

Implement an Autosuggest component

## Delivery Hero 2019

Implement a weather app.

## Fleetstudio 2019

Create a super simple search and display anime database like https://myanimelist.net/search/ all or https://anilist.co/search/anime using the APIs available at https://jikan.docs.apiary.io

## Bookmyshow 2019

Recreate our Video section from the API, mocks, and a video of the interaction provided. Try to design the page to the best of your ability. We intentionally don't provide pixel perfect designs to see your aptitude for visual design in Front-end.

The video player you use needs to have custom controls and also captions should be added using the mentioned SRT file. Use the same SRT file for all videos.

You will be tested mostly on the UI, functionality, and maintainable code. Make sure you test all possible cases when building this.

No JS framework is required to do this test, and you're free to use whatever you want.
PS. The trailer video is inserted in the row above the selected movie; not in a modal or top of the page. So you’ll have to figure out how to insert the trailer in between two rows in certain scenarios

Here’s the API:

(This api is allowed only over secure connection and accepts pageNumber and pageLimit as queryParams)

## Revolut 2019

Open the current Revolut app, on either iOS or Android, and navigate to the exchange screen.

- If the app is not available in your country you can observe how application works in video ​https://youtu.be/c0zPSiKYipc?t=29s​. (Exchange screen is on the 29th second of the video). P.s. It is not required to implement rates screen (1-05 from the video)

- Implement ​functionality​ of this screen in your own custom web widget using FX rates from either source:

a) http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html#dev

b) https://openexchangerates.org/

c) Your preferred source of FX rates

## Bulb 2021

### Background
Meter readings are a major part of Bulb’s business. We use them to measure how much energy a member has used, so we can bill them correctly.

The difference between two readings tells us the energy used between those two periods.

### Inputs

For each function we ask you to write below, you should expect an array of meter reading objects. A meter reading object contains two keys:
 - cumulative - the reading as an integer, and,
 - readingDate - an ISO 8601 formatted date string, in UTC.

You can refer to this sample dataset to see what this looks like, and use it as example data for your unit tests. We’ll also test your functions with other sets of data (but the data structure will always be the same).

For any inputs, you can assume the following:
 - Meter readings (cumulative) never go down or reset
 - There is at most one meter reading per month
 - The reading date will always have the time set to 00:00:00.000
 - Meter readings are only ever whole numbers
 - The input array/list will always be sorted from oldest to newest

### Question

We would like you to create two functions for us to process a set of meter readings. Both functions should expect an array of meter readings as their only parameter.

We want to be able to identify particularly large increases in our members’ energy usage.To help us do this, write a function that returns the reading that caused the biggest increase in energy usage from the reading before. The function should return a single meter reading object - the one that caused the jump in usage. Or if there’s nothing to choose from, it should return null. If there are two sets of readings with the same increase, return the reading that caused the earlier of the two increases. For example, if you’re given three meter readings in chronological order, 1000, 1500, 1750, then your function will return the object containing the 1500 meter reading (since it increases the reading by 500).

[{ cumulative, readingDate }, …] => { cumulative, readingDate }

## Nuri 2021

Create a web-based client for http://blockchain.info that allows users to list the latest blocks and details of each block. A block is just a data structure which groups transactions. For example:
