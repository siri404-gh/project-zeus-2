# What a Web developer should know

## Background

Web Developers are inherently Fullstack. They tend to have a focus area and some knowledge in other areas. Fullstack Development is a relatively new thing. It came into existence only in the past decade or so. The term is being thrown around like ragdolls these days. The term Fullstack came into existence with the coming of age of Javascript as a programming language and it was adopted in backend and IOT devices with the emergence of NodeJS which gave developers access to the filesystem which Javascript didnt. These days, Fullstack development seems to have many branches or rather the most popular languages web or otherwise have come under the umbrella of Fullstack.
In this post, I will be focusing on Fullstack Development used in the Web with a focus on frontend (as that's my speciality) and how to go about learning it. In my experience, working over 10 years in the field, I have realized that the following things are important and are expected of an Engineer.

## Problem Solving

First and foremost is problem solving. You need to have strong knowledge in programming. You need to be fluent in DataStructures and Algorithms. Irrespective of you being frontend or backend focused, this is a must for any Software Engineer. And I agree. Given a problem, you need to be able to come up with a consice solution using code in a time and space efficient way.  I used Leetcode, Hackerrank and Hackerearth for this.

## Domain knowledge

Web is the domain I work on. I needed to have a decent knowledge of how things work in the web. I have been living in the web for most of my life. So this came easy for me. I built expertise by building a lof of stuff, working on a lot of projects, creating something end to end and deploying to production.

## Frontend

**Note**: I will lay emphasis on Frontend as it has been my core area. If backend is your core area, lay more focus on that.

In frontend, your work will revolve to the most extent around Javascript. So, its imperative that you master it. Then comes the frameworks. These include React (60%), Angular and Vue (20% each). Some companies expect some native knowledge like React Native/Flutter. You could use some online learning platform to learn these. I relied on documentations, POCs, and personal projects for this in addition to working in the field. One common mistake developers do is to jump into the frameworks without having a strong knowledge of the basics of Javascript. This is because there are 2 kinds of developers. Those who are focussed on getting a quick job and those who are in the field for the long haul. Shortcuts get you only as far as the average jobs out there and the competition for those jobs is great.

## Backend

You need to be good in any one of the backend languages. Python seems to be in hot demand these days. For me it was NodeJS. It could be Java/Python/Go/C# or whatever. But whichever it may be for you, you need to have a strong grasp of the concepts. I use NodeJS in the backend at work and in my personal projects. You could use online learning portals like Udemy, Coursera etc, but that wont give you the field experience required.

## Databases

You need to be able to design, configure and use databases. You need to know the pros and cons of certain types of databases and you need to be able to tell which one to use for what usecases.

## DevOps/Networking

It is essential that you know things like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud solutions etc. You need to be able to wite the code and know how to take it to production and monitor it after its release. Doing a GCP Certification or preparing for it helps a great deal.

## Testing

You need to be able to follow a TDD/BDD approach in writing software. You need to be able to tell when and where unit tests/e2e tests are required. Some companies go for only BDD. It gives them enough confidence that the application works. Some companies go for a combination of TDD and BDD. But, from what I see, BDD seems to be the way forward.

## System Design

You need to be able to come up with the design for a problem statement. Some examples include designing Uber, Instagram etc. You need to be able to discuss the approach you take for your design.

## Software Engineering

Lastly, you need to be able to write clean, efficient, readable, scalable and maintainable code. You also need to be able to do code review and pair programming. These are essential for the company's survival.

## Conclusion

You cannot build this expertise with just training alone. This needs years of perfection to accomplish. If you are a beginner, it helps to know what is out there. If you are mid-level, its time for you to go deeper into these areas. If you are senior, its time to mentor others and show them the way. If you are a lead, its time to do research and architectural decisions for the company.
