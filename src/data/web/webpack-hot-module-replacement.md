# Webpack Hot Module Replacement

## Summary

We have seen how webpack-dev-server creates a local server to serve the bundled files. But, you needed to refresh the browser to see any update after a change in code. With Hot module replacement, webpack just injects updates in the code into the live app. No reloading of the browser is then required. Saves a great deal of time.

## Configure

Modify your `webpack.dev.js` to this:

## Code

```js
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const commonConfig = require('./webpack.common');

module.exports = merge(commonConfig, {
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, '../_dist'),
    compress: true,
    hot: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
});
```

Also, add the following line of code to the react entry point file.

```js
if(module.hot) module.hot.accept();
```

Stop and start webpack-dev-server again.

## See it in Action

When enabled, you can see the following in the browser console.

```shell
[HMR] Waiting for update signal from WDS...
[WDS] Hot Module Replacement enabled.
```

Make some changes to the code, save it and see it automatically update the live app instantly without a refresh and you can see the following in the console.

```shell
[WDS] App updated. Recompiling...
[WDS] App hot update...
[HMR] Checking for updates on the server...
[HMR] Updated modules:
[HMR]  - ./src/web/posts/webpack/hot_module_relacement.md
[HMR]  - ./src/web/posts sync recursive ^\.\/.*\.md$
[HMR]  - ./src/web/components/Content/Content.js
[HMR]  - ./src/web/components/App/App.js
[HMR] App is up to date.
```

Also, if you see in the network tab, a hot-update file would have been fetched and injected as a result of which you'll see the update in the browser without having to manually refresh the page.
