# Webpack Common Setup

&nbsp;

## Summary

Now that we have the webpack dev and the webpack prod configurations, we have some duplicate code in either of them. Lets move these to a file called `webpack.common.js` and include this during build time. So when we run the dev buid, it will run common + dev and when we run the prod build, it will run common + prod.

## Install
```shell
npm i --save-dev webpack-merge
```

## Configure

Create a file called `_webpack/webpack.common.js` at the root and move any common code to this file. Also, make changes to the dev config and the prod config to include this.

## Code - webpack.common.js

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: './src/client/index.js',
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../_dist'),
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    publicPath: '/',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'My Website',
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, 'template/template.html'),
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Code - webpack.dev.js

```js
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const commonConfig = require('./webpack.common');

module.exports = merge(commonConfig, {
  mode: 'development',
});
```

## Code - webpack.prod.js

```js
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const commonConfig = require('./webpack.common');

module.exports = merge(commonConfig, {
  mode: 'production',
});
```

## Execute

```shell
npx webpack --env=prod --config=_webpack/webpack.config.js
```


Commit and push.
