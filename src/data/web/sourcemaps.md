# Sourcemaps

&nbsp;

## Summary

While debugging an error, because the bundled file is in a minified and mangled state, it becomes cumbursome to find which part of your code generated the error. In such a scenario, wouldnt it be nice to have a mapping of the bundled code and the actual source code? Thats exactly what soucemaps do. While bundling, webpack maintains a mapping of the generated bundle and the actual source code.

Lets try this.

## Error

Introduce an error in the code like this. Modify the entry point `src/index.js`.

```js
render(<App />, document.getElementById('root2'));
```

Run webpack-dev-server.

```shell
npx webpack-dev-server --open --env=dev --config=webpack/webpack.config.js
```

This will open the browser but you wont see anything. Open the console and you will see an error like below because our template doesnt have a div with id='root2'.

If you look closely, the error doesn't say where it originates from. This is what we are going to solve using sourcemaps.

## Enable sourcemaps to debug issue

Modify `webpack.dev.js` to include the below code

```js
...
devtool: 'inline-source-map',
```

Run webpack-dev-server again. This time, the error looks a bit different like this:

![webpack sourcemap](/posts/web/webpack-sourcemap.png "webpack sourcemap")

Now if you look closely, the error tells where it originates from. Go to the sources tab and press `cmd+p`. Search for `index.js`. You will be able to see and debug your code which you wouldn't have been able to see without sourcemaps enabled. You can now spot the error and fix it.

Undo the error, commit and push.
